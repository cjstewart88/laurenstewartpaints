      <h2>About Lauren</h2>

      <img class="about-picture" src="images/lauren.png">

      <p>
        Lauren Stewart is a native of Atlanta, Georgia.  Her passion for painting
        began early in her youth; however, as she pursued a future in medicine, she
        had little time to dedicate herself to her artwork.  After recently leaving
        her medical career with the birth of her son, she has revisited the joys of
        creating art once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        With no formal training in painting, Lauren is completely self-taught.  She
        works in acrylics on canvas.  Lauren's art focuses primarily on the serenity
        of nature with a specific focus on beautiful, open fields and majestic skies.
      </p>

      <p>
        She currently lives in Smyrna, Georgia with her loving husband, son, and dog, Rocko.
